### _**Aim of the Experiment**_
To study and implement the NumPy library in Python for performing efficient numerical computations, including array creation and use of built-in mathematical functions.

### **_Theory_** 
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and a collection of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays efficiently.

### Why NumPy is Used
- Faster than Python lists
- Efficient memory usage
- Used for numerical computations
- Forms the base for libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib

### Declaration of NumPy
- NumPy is imported using import numpy as np
- Arrays are created using np.array()
- NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type, which improves performance

### Array Creation Methods Used
- np.array() → creates an array
- np.arange() → generates values in a given range
- np.linspace() → generates evenly spaced values
- np.eye() → creates an identity matrix

### Built-in Functions Used
- np.mean() → calculates mean of array elements
- np.median() → calculates median
- np.max() → finds maximum value
- np.min() → finds minimum value
- np.sum() → calculates sum of elements

These functions simplify complex mathematical operations and reduce code length while improving execution speed.

### _**Conclusion**_
In this experiment, the NumPy library was successfully implemented to perform various numerical operations. Array creation methods and built-in functions such as mean, median, maximum, minimum, and sum were studied. This experiment demonstrates that NumPy provides faster, cleaner, and more efficient ways to handle numerical data compared to traditional Python lists.
